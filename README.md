# Simple Data Storage with Python

**Author**: [Grace Bonarigo]

## Purpose:
This tutorial will guide you through creating a simple Python program that demonstrates how to use file-based storage (JSON format) for persisting data. You'll learn how to manage data using Python's built-in libraries to store, retrieve, and modify the information.

## Target Audience:
- Beginners in Python programming who want to learn about file handling and data power.
- Anyone looking to learn the basics of data storage using Python.

## Steps:
- [Step 1: Set up the Python environment](setup_python.md)
- [Step 2: Create the basic data storage program](data_storage_program.md)
- [Step 3: Implement functions to interact with the data](interact_with_data.md)
- [Step 4: Test and verify data storage](test_data_storage.md)
